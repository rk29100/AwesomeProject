Place half teaspoon of extra-virgin of coconut oil in a small microwave-safe bowl and warm it up for a few seconds. Using cotton swabs, apply the oil generously inside each nostril, so that there is a good thorough coating. Apply it 2 or 3 times a day, especially before going to bed. You can also use extra-virgin olive oil in place of coconut oil to treat nasal passage dryness.\n\n3. Pour hot water into a large bowl. Add a few drops of an essential oil of your choice. Cover your head with a towel and inhale the steam from the bowl for about 10 minutes. Repeat 2 to 4 times a day. Even a hot, steamy shower will allow steam to circulate in your nasal cavity.',
